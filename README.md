# Why Fake News is a problem?

Fake news refers to misinformation, disinformation, or mal-information which is spread through word of mouth and traditional media and more recently through digital forms of communication such as edited videos, memes, unverified advertisements, and social media propagated rumors. Fake news spread through social media has become a serious problem, with the potential of it resulting in mob violence, suicides etc as a result of misinformation circulated on social media.

This dataset consists of about 40000 articles consisting of fake "Fake.csv" as well as real news "True.csv". Our aim is to train our model so that it can correctly predict whether a given piece of news is real or fake. The fake and real news data is given in two separate datasets with each dataset consisting of around 20000 articles each.
